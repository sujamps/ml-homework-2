    "In this assignment we'll implement the Decision Tree algorithm to classify patients as either having or not having diabetic retinopathy. For this task we'll be using the Diabetic Retinopathy data set, which contains features from the Messidor image set to predict whether an image contains signs of diabetic retinopathy or not. This dataset has `1150` instances and `20` attributes (some categorical, some continuous). You can find additional details about the dataset [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/329/diabetic+retinopathy+debrecen)."
